description: Database highlighting DMV's musicians and trends
---

This unique database highlights the achievements of 30 solo artists and 60 bands from the Washington, D.C. area, covering genres like go-go, jazz, rap, R&B, and punk rock, to increase their global recognition and showcase music trends over the last four decades.

**The database consists of 11 tables with the following structure:**

1. Main Tables:
      * Bands and Artists
3. Reference Tables:
      * Instruments
      * Record Labels
      * Albums
3. Linking Tables:
      * Band_instruments
      * Label_bands
      * Label_artists
      * Artist_instruments
      * Artist_albums

**The database includes various one-to-many relationships among all tables.**






 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a footnote [^1].

[^1]: Some footnote text.

Tables can look like this:

| Header 1 | Header 2                   | Header 3 |
|:--------:|:--------------------------:|:--------:|
| data1a   | Data is longer than header | 1        |
| d1b      | add a cell                 |          |
| lorem    | ipsum                      | 3        |
|          | empty outside cells        |          |
| skip     |                            | 5        |
| six      | Morbi purus                | 6        |


A horizontal rule follows.

Here's a definition list:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.

oranges
  : Citrus!

tomatoes
  : There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term and  its definition to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block" (note how whitespace is honored):

| Line one
|   Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

Inline math equation: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line like so:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$
