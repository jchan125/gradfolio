title: WSTC Missed Trips Analysis
description: My Capstone project analyzing bus ridership for equitable transport in Maryland
---

The mission of the Washington Suburban Transit Commission (WSTC) is to enhance public transportation services and infrastructure in Montgomery County and Prince George's County, Maryland, with a focus on promoting efficient, accessible, and sustainable mass transit options. This project analyzes bus ridership data related to missed trips from three bus service providers: WMATA, Ride On, and The Bus. It also examines these missed trips in relation to Equity Emphasis Areas, which are regions with high concentrations of low-income individuals and/or traditionally disadvantaged racial and ethnic groups.

*To protect confidentiality, sensitive information such as specific bus routes, names, and operator numbers has been omitted or anonymized per security guidelines. The project aims to provide insights to the WSTC on factors contributing to missed trips, supporting their mission to improve transportation services for underprivileged communities.*

*This summary maintains the project's focus and goals while ensuring that sensitive information is safeguarded*

I worked as the Project Manager and Data Analyst on this project and will be presenting what I have contributed.

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

H2 Header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it by specifying the languagae after the start of a block (e.g. `~~~python`) which would look like :

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print(i)
~~~

### An H3 header ###

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a footnote [^1].

[^1]: Some footnote text.

Tables can look like this:

| Header 1 | Header 2                   | Header 3 |
|:--------:|:--------------------------:|:--------:|
| data1a   | Data is longer than header | 1        |
| d1b      | add a cell                 |          |
| lorem    | ipsum                      | 3        |
|          | empty outside cells        |          |
| skip     |                            | 5        |
| six      | Morbi purus                | 6        |


A horizontal rule follows.

***

Here's a definition list:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.

oranges
  : Citrus!

tomatoes
  : There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term and  its definition to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block" (note how whitespace is honored):

| Line one
|   Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

Inline math equation: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line like so:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$
