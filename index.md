Hi there, my name is Janet Chan!

I am a recent graduate of the University of Maryland with a Bachelor of Science in `Information Science`. Specializing in Data Science, I have developed a solid foundation in Python, SQL, R, and data visualization tools like Tableau. My minor in `Science, Technology, Ethics, and Policy (STEP)` complements my technical expertise with a broader understanding of technology's ethical and policy implications.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have honed my skills through various roles and projects. As an `Undergraduate Teaching Assistant`, I guided students in developing functional app prototypes, integrating discussions on metadata schemas for effective data organization. My role as a Student Lead at `Terrapin Tech`, under the Division of Information Technology, allowed me to supervise and mentor a team, significantly increasing productivity and customer satisfaction. Additionally, I enhanced `MyCyberExec`â€™s website, leading to a substantial increase in user engagement.

My portfolio includes projects that showcase my analytical abilities, such as the Washington Suburban Transit Commission Ridership Analysis and crime trend analysis in urban areas. To see more projects:

I am passionate about leveraging data for informed decision-making and innovative solutions. My technical skills, combined with experience in teaching, leadership, and customer service, allow me to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

I am excited to grow in data science, contribute to meaningful projects, and collaborate with diverse teams to solve real-world problems.
