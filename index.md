Hi there, my name is Janet Chan!

I am a recent graduate of the University of Maryland with a Bachelor of Science in

`Information Science`. 
Specializing in Data Science, I have developed a solid foundation in Python, SQL, R, and data visualization tools like Tableau. My minor in `Science, Technology, Ethics, and Policy (STEP)` complements my technical expertise with a broader understanding of technology's ethical and policy implications.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have honed my skills through various roles and projects. As an `Undergraduate Teaching Assistant`, I guided students in developing functional app prototypes, integrating discussions on metadata schemas for effective data organization. My role as a Student Lead at `Terrapin Tech`, under the Division of Information Technology, allowed me to supervise and mentor a team, significantly increasing productivity and customer satisfaction. Additionally, I enhanced `MyCyberExec`â€™s website, leading to a substantial increase in user engagement.

I am passionate about leveraging data for informed decision-making and innovative solutions. My technical skills, combined with experience in teaching, leadership, and customer service, allow me to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

I am excited to grow in data science, contribute to meaningful projects, and collaborate with diverse teams to solve real-world problems.
