Hi there, my name is Janet Chan!

I am an aspiring Data Analyst with a Bachelor of Science in 'Information Science' from the 'University of Maryland, College Park'. Specializing in Data Science, I have developed a solid foundation in Python, SQL, R, and data visualization tools like Tableau. My minor in 'Science, Technology, Ethics, and Policy (STEP)' complements my technical expertise with a broader understanding of technology's ethical and policy implications.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have honed my skills through various roles and projects. As an 'Undergraduate Teaching Assistant', I guided students in developing functional app prototypes, integrating discussions on metadata schemas for effective data organization. My role as a Student Lead at 'Terrapin Tech', under the Division of Information Technology, allowed me to supervise and mentor a team, significantly increasing productivity and customer satisfaction. Additionally, I enhanced 'MyCyberExec'â€™s website, leading to a substantial increase in user engagement.

My portfolio includes projects that showcase my analytical abilities, such as the Washington Suburban Transit Commission Ridership Analysis and crime trend analysis in urban areas. These projects highlight my proficiency in Python and ArcGIS, as well as my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.

I am passionate about leveraging data to drive informed decision-making and create innovative solutions. My technical skills, coupled with my experience in teaching, leadership, and customer service, enable me to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

I am excited to continue growing in the field of data science, contributing to meaningful projects, and collaborating with diverse teams to solve real-world problems.
